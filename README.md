### The website is still under modifications, but some of the content can already be viewed.
### After the approval of the supervisors , I will upload the thesis to this project.

## A Short Introduction of the topic of the thesis:
### My motivation comes from how we annotate the genes. There have been softwares developed for automatic gene annotations. Their algorithmic designs are based on assigning the gene functions of the orthologs to the unknown genes. Many researchers casted doubt on this approach that whether the assignment of gene function of an orthologous gene are always a optimal strategy to annotate a gene. In 2011, Nehrt et al. coined the applied  functional similarity analysis on GO-terms and expression correlation analysis on microarray datasets.  After the refutation of the conjecture by Nehrt et al., there were many articles that examined ortholog conjecture. In 2020, Stamboulian \emph{et al.} examined once more the ortholog conjecture with functional similarity analyses and showed once again that the ortholog conjecture does not hold on the gene annotations in the UniProt database. In this thesis, the works of Stamboulian \emph{et al.} (2020) \cite{stamboulian} are examined and extended, including more species pairs and the expression correlation analyses on RNA-seq datasets to view this issue in a more broader context.

## The Introduction of the Directories:
### Directory codes_and_files includes the raw data, the pre-processed data and the implementations of the functional similarity and expression correlation analyses.
### Directory figures includes the plots that are generated for the comparison of functional similarity and expression correlation of every species pair. 
#### There are also more README files for detailed introductions in each directory.
